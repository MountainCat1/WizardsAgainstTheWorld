! SERIOUS:

- Bullets MUST be fps-dependent, or I have no other explanation. when I was fighting the Swarm Queen and my laptop started struggling, ALL of my bullets just passed through her hordes or didn't appear (didn't see them on the screen at least), so just couldn't fight it at all.
  After I wrote it here and my laptop chilled down a bit, it was back to being muuuch easier and all the bullets hit.

BIG:
- Really weird EXP gain?.. Don't get it at all... Gained like 3 levels from Megatron kill, but nothing else gives exp really. Gained at least visible exp from killing federation people.
* seems fine??

MEDIUM:

SMALL:
- Feels a bit off at the start of the game to see camera panning from void to the start room. Maybe a fade in could be better.
- Still bad text skipping system in the intro
- In tutorial the "blip" sound is always 100%, not connected to settings, much louder if you have your other sounds low
- Still no good view when "no item" in Upgrade section. Also needs renaming?.. Cuz it's now also a Scraper... But no idea how to solve that honestly.
- Last scrap crate in Tutorial is still broken
- The Eye cursor icon seems a bit small, kinda looks just like a dot, but compeletely fine
- Every time I pick something up I get a small lag spike (I assume cuz you do a inventory save). Not too bad, really small one, but still
- The "coin" symbol is different font, makes me uncomfortable x3
  You can just make a up a pic for it yourself, or just use normal "c", I think it's fine. Maybe a dollar, but yeah fuck americans
- Maybe keep the user's zoom level? I prefer a zoom "-1 from default" and it's a bit annoying to move it around every time 'x3
  But that's really minor!
- Healing Plaster heals even if the unit is full health. Personal preference though, fine with me.
- When you rescue a person from a Cryopod, they are not added to drain of the juice counter. I like it, just informing in case that's not intentional
- Inconsistent use of ' and ` in text (the thing gpt uses)



WEIRD:
- In tutorial got a weird bug (I assume really weird positioning, my units just couldn't hit the zombies, bullets went through them (I still assume bullets are fps dependant somehow, cuz really feels like it 'x3)
- Haven't seen a single cryolab until the last(!), 6th level... Don't know if it is needed or not, but maybe force at least one, maybe on a 2-3 level? Not sure though.
- When traveling to the next loop with 0 fuel, I randomly had additional 2 fuel... Maybe I'm stupid though.
