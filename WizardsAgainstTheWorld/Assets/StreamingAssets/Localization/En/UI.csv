Trader.Breadator.Name,Breadator
Trader.Breadator.Description,"Leader of the robot revolution 3128, Breadator is a ruthless trader who deals in high-tech modules for ships and their crew. Rumor is that a simple maintenance bot gained sentience, as well as the taste for power, after connecting itself to a piece of bread. His motivations are driven by his hatred towards those who eat his kind."
Trader.MadamEva.Name,Madam Eva
Trader.MadamEva.Description,"Once rumored to be of noble birth, Madam Eva traded silk and silver for shadows and subterfuge. Now a high-end supplier of anything that isn't just point-and-shoot — medkits, hacking rigs, stealth gear, and tech most people don’t even recognize. If it takes finesse, finesse is what she sells."
Trader.Meinhass.Name,Meinhass
Trader.Meinhass.Description,"A mysterious trader dealing exclusively in items designed for devastation. His wares are as dangerous as his motives: to spread destruction, plain and simple. Whispers in the darker corners of the galaxy claim his infamy began with a brutal act — pipebombing his own mother to make a name for himself."
Trader.Treatie.Name,Treatie
Trader.Treatie.Description,"A ruthless arms dealer with a singular passion: delivering death at high velocity. If it fires bullets, shells, or slugs — especially the kind that tear through armor — Treatie’s your guy. Mercy isn’t in his inventory."
